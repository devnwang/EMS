# Employee Management System

An Employee Management System (EMS) that allows for the addition and removal of Employees, as well as listing and updating Employee information. Additionally, the EMS can keep track of all the departments and the employees within them.

Initial list of employees and their information are imported from a text file which is then transferred to a csv file. Any further reads or updates are through the csv file.
